# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?\
I feel fairly confident in how to utilize for statements.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?\
It felt quite hard. I got stuck a few times and had to spend a decent amount of time googling answers to things that seemed simple, but that I simply lacked knowledge in.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?\
I may add some time into my calendar to look up other basic challenges to practice conditionals, arrays, and for statements to sharpen my skills.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?\
None at the moment. But I will google when they come up!
